                <h2>Comment System</h2>
                <p>The great thing about Code Convo is that everyone has an incentive to give and receive feedback. Our comment system is based on a points system. Want some feedback on your new project? Great! Just make a post to start out, and you can begin receiving feedback. Want feedback on another project? You'll need to earn some Convo Points by giving some feedback to someone else. Every comment you make on someone else's post that is above 350 characters will net you one point. What this means is that<strong> everyone gets great feedback when they post</strong>!

                <p>At Code Convo, we have a healthy moderation system. If 4 or more users flag a comment or post, that post will go through our moderation system, where our systems will decide whether or not that post needs to be removed, the post needs to be closed from further comment, or that further action is required by our administrators. At Code Convo, we pride ourselves on a healthy vibrant community, and we want to do whatever we can to keep our users safe on our website.</p>
